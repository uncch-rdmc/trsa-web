== Testing the Docker image
To stand up a test deployment:
----
	$ docker pull odumunc/trsa-web:2.0

	$ docker run --name trsa-web -p 8080:8080 --restart unless-stopped odumunc/trsa-web:2.0
----
Then use a web browser to visit the container's IP:
----
	$ links http://172.17.0.2:8080/trsa-web-2.0
----

== Building your Docker container
To build your own Docker container:

* Edit `trsa.config` to suit your needs, then `docker build` with your desired name and tag.


== Version 3: how to build a docker image and run its container

=== Major changes

* The official Payara sever-full image (JDK-11 version) is used as the base image; this implies the user is payara, not root.
* The file storage directory was changed to `/opt/payara/trsa/files` from `/trsa/files`.
* The context root no longer has a version-tag segment: `/trsa-web` not `/trsa-web-2.0` .
* Each version has its own dockerfile and its corresponding `trsa.config` file
** for version 3.0, its dockerfile = `v3.dockerfile` and its trsa.config file = `v3.trsa.config`, e.g., 
+
----
docker build -t odumunc/trsa-web:3.211216 -f v3.Dockerfile .
----

== Version 4 (currently under development in `postgres` branch)
==== Major changes 
* H2 Database was replaced with PostgreSQL; PostgreSQL is expected to be running independently from TRSA-Web
* This version of `docker-compose.yml` relies on `v4.Dockerfile` and `v4.trsa.config`
* To run with `docker compose`, the JDBC resource/connection settings were set at the server level, i.e., not specified within the war file of TRSA-Web.
* To test the `docker compose` version with a Dockerized Dataverse instance such the Docker-all-in-one version, connect the Docker-all-in-one version via `docker network` command.
